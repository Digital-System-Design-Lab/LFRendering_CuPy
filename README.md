# LFRendering_CuPy
GPU-based Light Field Rendering with CuPy, pyTOFlow

# Prerequisites

# NumPy, Cupy
To store and calculate images, NumPy and CuPy modules are used. CuPy is used for calculation in GPU environment.

## PyTorch
Our implementation is based on PyTorch 0.4.1, but we can use the other versions. The current environment is PyTorch 1.7.1.

## TOFlow
The part of interpolation is based on pyTOFlow, so we need modules and files in https://github.com/Coldog2333/pytoflow.
